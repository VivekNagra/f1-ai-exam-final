# Formula 1 AI Exam Project

This repository contains both **Part 1 (Supervised Learning Dashboard)** and **Part 2 (RAG-based Question Answering with LLaMA2)** for the AI exam project.


## PART 1: Supervised Learning Dashboard (Streamlit)

### Step 1: Install dependencies
Use  venv.
with venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd part1_presentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run the Jupyter Notebook

Run the analysis notbook (run all cells) and train the model 
to start the notebook run the command (from inside the dir part1_presentation )

```bash
jupyter notebook 
```

This will generate a trained `model.pkl`, inside the part1_presentation fodler.


### Step 3: Run the Streamlit Dashboard
exit the notebook server if not alr done (ctrl+c)

the run the command:

```bash
streamlit run part1_presentation.py
```

from here you should see the streamlit app with the part 1 app:

## PART 2: RAG-based AI with LLaMA2 and ChromaDB

### Step 1: Set up a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure Ollama is running with LLaMA2 and OpenWebUI (Docker-based).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Create the vectorstore

```bash
cd part2_rag_llama
python create_vectorstore.py
```

This will embed and persist the documents into `./chromadb/`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Ask a Question via CLI

```bash
python cli.py "Who had the best grid position in the race?"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Part 1 (model.pkl errors)

If you get a `TypeError` related to NumPy or `joblib`:

### üîÅ Option 1: Retrain the model
Re-run the notebook in your current environment and re-save:

```python
joblib.dump(model, "../part1_presentation/model.pkl")
```

### üß© Option 2: Use cloudpickle instead of joblib

Change in `part1_presentation.py`:

```python
# Replace this
import joblib
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

# With this
import cloudpickle
with open("model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = cloudpickle.load(f)
```
